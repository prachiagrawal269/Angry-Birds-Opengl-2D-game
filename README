#### IceCream World
IceCream World is a 2D game developed using Opengl (c++ lamguage). 

###### Game Layout
The game environment consists of an icecream trolley which contains of a cone with a icecream scoop over it. There is a target cone on which a player can fire the scoop.
The player can change the angle of projection of the scoop and also vary its speed which will be visible in the speed bar.
There is a "warm region" present in the game environment (above part of the game scene, orage-yellow in colour). As soon as the icecream scoop enters into this region, it melts. As a consequence of which the radius of the scoop decreases.
All laws of physics including gravity, ground friction, air friction, collision (both elastic and inelastic) are taken into account. 
The player has 3 chances in all to project the ball onto the target cone. The scoring of the game depends upon the radius of the scoop that finally reaches into the target cone.


######Directory Structure:
The "IcecreamWorld" module consists of following files:

a.) game.cpp : Contains code controlling major functionality of the game.
b.) board.cpp : Contains functions for "creation of various shapes e.g. rectangle, triangle, line, etc". Also contains classes for various objects along with their attributes and methods.
c.) global.h : Its a header file that contains all the global variables used across the game files.
d.) glad : folder that contains the file "glad.c" essential for running the codebase.
e.) Makefile : Its a makefile that contains the command to compile the code and create the "executable".
f.) game : Its the executale file that will actually run the code.
g.) help.pdf : This file contains the basic instructions to play the game.
h.) game.frag  : Fragment Shader
i.) game.vert : vertex Shader
j.) glad.c

How to run the code: (only on linux platform)
1. Run "make" into the "GAME" folder.
2. Run "./game"
